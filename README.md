## ðŸ“Œ About me

I am a Computer Science student interested in the area of â€‹Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. I believe in the power of technology to solve real problems and transform lives, and it is with this purpose that I have been following my journey.

I have a deep commitment to learning. I am always looking for new knowledge, whether through courses, personal projects or mentoring. Constantly driven by curiosity and the desire to always evolve, both as a professional and as a person. My biggest goal is to use AI as a tool for positive impact, helping people and companies make smarter decisions, optimize processes and overcome challenges.

I'm looking for an internship or first job opportunity that allows me to learn from the best, contribute energy and grow together. If you believe in the potential of young talent committed to learning and innovation, let's connect!
